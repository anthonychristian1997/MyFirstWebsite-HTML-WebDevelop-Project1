# MyFirstWebsite-WebDeveloper-HTML-Project1
In this repository, I learned how to make a website. In this repository, I use HTML and CSS to build a website

A website is built based on 3 parts:
1. HTML working as a framework.
2. CSS that works as the skin.
3. and JavaScript which works like the brain.

Building a website is necessary to understand and understand, in combining the 3 programming languages ​​into a single unit.
