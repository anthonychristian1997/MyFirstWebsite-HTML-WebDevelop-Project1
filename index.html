                <p>I was born on June 9, 1997, in Jakarta. 
                    I am the oldest of 3 siblings. 
                    I am an alumni graduate of one of the most populous universities in Jakarta, 
                    namely the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, 
                    where I majored in financial management.</p>

                <p>I am currently pursuing a career working as a data scientist. 
                    Even though in reality there are many plans and goals that 
                    I want to achieve have to be delayed due to the current pandemic. 
                    I was also lucky and had the opportunity to get a pre-employment program from the government. 
                    I was also interested in learning skills as a web-developer. 
                    For me, this is the best moment to learn many things to prepare myself for the future.</p>

                <p>As I said before, I studied at one of the best universities in Jakarta, 
                    namely the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia.
                    When I was in semester 7 of college I decided to find a job. 
                    At that time, what was on my mind was looking for experience and work. 
                    For some reason, because of my hard work, 
                    I got a job as a business development at a chemical industry distributor company, for me, 
                    it was a valuable opportunity that I certainly shouldn't waste.</p>

                <p>In achieving my goals I have several goals that I certainly want to achieve. 
                    I want to pursue my career working as a Data Scientist in the future. 
                    Then become a consultant at a company. 
                    Take several certifications that can later be useful in building a career. 
                    Be an impact wherever I am. Those are some of the goals 
                    I want to achieve in the next few years.</p>

                The theme I chose was quite simple,  "My own life". In making this web submission, 
                I tried to apply all the things I had learned during this month's Decoding class. 
                Even though there are still many shortcomings, in the future 
                I will continue to learn to improve and create a better website.</b></p>
